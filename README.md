# Mini-App-Projects

The repository for store the mobile application projects. The objective is for only practicing to build the mobile applications both iOS and Android. In the future, It would probably contains more about mobile, desktop, watchOS, or even tvOS applications.

Currently, I'm using Kotlin language to develop an Android application on simulator mobile.  

Some of the projects resources can be found at [Complete iOS App Development Bootcamp Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/ios-13-app-development-bootcamp/) on Udemy website.
